                            GLS, the name is nostalgia! Go and ask any “GLSian” and you will understand that GLS is not
                            just a college, it’s a
                            feeling. It marked the beginning of the journey that we are upon right now. All of my
                            colleagues are champion of their
                            field and it might not be limited to IT. GLSICA taught us the value of friendship,
                            integrity, honour and most
                            importantly sustainability. We are still close to our professors and we still reminisce the
                            days we spent here.

                            A students’ career is very similar to a new born baby. It has to be moulded and nurtured
                            properly to have a constant
                            growth. With the updation in technology on daily basis, it becomes very difficult to
                            sustain in the IT industry. At
                            GLS, the course curriculum is at par with the industry standards and gets updated with new
                            and upcoming technologies so
                            by the time the student completes his/her college education would be well versed with the
                            current technologies.
